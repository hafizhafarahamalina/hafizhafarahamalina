**About me 👋**
Hi, I’m Hafizha Farah Amalina. Since February 2024, I’ve been pursuing a career in Quality Assurance (QA), where I’m thrilled to grow and thrive. While specializing in QA, I’m also expanding my skills in areas like IoT Programming, AI, AWS, Machine Learning, Project Management, and Software Testing. I’m passionate about making digital spaces more accessible and inclusive. Through this portfolio, I’ll share my QA knowledge courses, self-study, and work in QA Research and Development at Samsung Research Indonesia. I have also started learning test automation in, so at the moment my main focus is on furthering my knowledge (and practice!) in this area.
